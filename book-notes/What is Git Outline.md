1. **Version control system (VCS)**
	1. Git is a VCS that allows you to track changes to files over time. It records each modification, allowing you to view, compare, and revert to previous versions.
2. **Distributed**
	1. Git is a distrubuted VCS, meaning that every team member has a local copy of teh entire respositiy, including the complete hisotry of changes. This enables offline work and east collaboration
3. **Branching and Merging**
	1. Git encourages the user of branches, which are independent lines of development. Branches allows developers to work on differen tfeatures or bug fixes simulataneously. Git provides efficient merging capahbilities to combine branches with they changes are ready.
4. **Commit**
	1. A commit is a specific point in the history of a Git repo. it caputres a snapshot of the files at a given time and includes a commit message describing the changes made.
5. **Repository**
	1. A git repo is a collection of file and directories associaled with a projects. it contains the entire history of changes made to the project, as well as information about branches, commits and tags
6. **Remote repos**
	1. Git enables collaboration by allowing multtiple developers to work on the same project. Remote repos, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, serve as centeralized repos where team members can push their changes, share code, and review each other's work.
7. **Push and Pull**
	1. Pushing refers to sending you local commit to the remote repo, updating it with your chage, pulling, on the other hand, involves retrieving and marging changes from teh remote repo into your local copy.
8. **Conflect Resolution**
	1. When multiple developers modify the same file or lnes of code, conflicts can occur during the merge process. Git provides tools to help resolve these conflexts by alloing developers to choose the desired changes manually.
9. **History and Log**
	1. Git maintains a detailed history of commits, making it easy to track changes, understand who made them, and review the evulation of the project. 
	2. The Git log provides the chronological list of commits, including commit messages and related information.
10. **Collaboration and Code Review**
	1. Git facilitate collaboration among team members by providing mechansisms for code review.
	2. Developers can review each other's chagnes, leave comments, suggest modifications, and ensure code quality before merging.

Git's flexibility, distributed nature, branching model, and strong collaboration features make it a powerful tool for managing code repos and facilitating efficent treamwork in software development projects. By using Git, develoers can effectlvely track cjagmes, wrok on different features concurrently, manage conflects, and maintain a compresensive hisotry of their project.
