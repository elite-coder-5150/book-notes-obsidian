#### What is component modularity?

Component modularity is a crucial best practice when developing angular apps. including social network apps. Modularity refers to breaking down the application into smaller, self contained components that encapsulate specific functionality or features.

#### 1. Single responsibility 

Each component should have a single responsibility and focus on a specific task or feature. For instance, you can have separate components for user profiles, posts, comments, notification, etc.

A good example of this would be a newsfeed component, which displays all of the post that a user has created.
