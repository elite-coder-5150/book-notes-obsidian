#### 1. **Organize your app into modules** 

Modules help keep you code organized by grouping related functionalit together, and each module should have a a clear responsibility.

For instance, lets say that you are converting a ui kit into code and you need to have a module named social for the social netowrk app and anoter module for the customer relations management (CRM), and yet another module for project management

Modules make it easy to group related functionality together, and get each module should have a single responsibility and it should be clear what that responsibility is. For instance, you are building a full stack e commerce solution and you need to create an admin panel to add, remove products. And create the inventory system, I would create two different modules for that, one for the inventory system and the other for admin portion of the app. 

I would build the inventory system first, because that seems to be th biggest challengs. Because I've abstracted enough apps to tell you that admin panels are the easier type of app that you can build. The most advanced part of the admin app is building the authentication system or use one that is pre-defined, like oauth or some passport variant. I think that I will go with the passport variant just because I have the most experience using node on the back end then I do any other Backend framework.

#### 2. **Each component, service, and module** 

each cmponent should have a single responsibility, which means that they should do one thing and do it will. This ensures that the code can stay fairly simple.

Each component that you build should have a single responsibility, which means that they should do one thing and do it well. This ensurs that the code stays fairly simple. And that is one of the advantages of angular is that it allows you to organize your code in ways that it makes since to you and what makes since for the project.

For instance, you don't want the news-feed to handle the database directly, that is what a service is for, is to separate the logic from the view. This means that you have to create a service that talks to the back end somehow. When doing so I would recommend using axios on te frontend to communicate with the server on the backend.

When it comes to naming modules, i would use the name advice as naming varaibles. I would name you modules after what they do. For example if you need an e commerce module i would call it commerce module, or what ever you decide to call the class.

When decide to use simple classes that have one purpose and they to it well, they become easier to test, and have a good maintainability. And as a bonus they are easier to understand then something that is overly complex. Which I think that is what makes codes smell is that the functions are too long because they try to accompilish to much and as a result have a much longer run time coefficient.

#### 3. **Use folder struture** 

To orgaize your code into logical groiups. For instance, you could have a folder for each module, with subfolders for components services, and other realted code.

1. I would store all my modules in a folder called modules
2. I have components in their own folder. Along with the unit test for the component. If you are using angular this is already done for you.
3. I would store all services in a folder called services
4. I would store all my interfaces in a folder called models

#### 4. **Use feature modules**  

I would further grouip related functionality together. For instance feature moduels can be lazy loaded, which can improve performance by reducing the initial load time of the application.

Feature modules can be loaded a later time when they are needed. For instnace, you app has two additional modules. one is for the admin panel and the other is the invitory system.

In the case of the inventory ssytem, that is a rather large application with a ton of features. 

7. **Use shared modules** - to share common components, services, and other code elements. this help to make the code easier to read and undersntand.

8. **Use consistent naming conversions** - for compnents, services, and other code elements. this helps make the code easier to read and understand.

9. **Use interfaces** - to define data models for your application. this help to ensure that the data is consistent and makes it easy to work with data across different parts of the application.

10. **Use linting tools** - like ESLint or TSLint to enforce coding standards and ensure that your code is consistent

In conclusion, by following thse best practices, you can keep your angular code organized and mantainable, which wil help you build high-quality we
