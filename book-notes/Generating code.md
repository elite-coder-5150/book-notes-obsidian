To write a program that generates code, you can use a variety of programming languages and techniques, depending on your goals and teh specific requirements of you program. Here is a high-level overview of the steps you can follow to write code-generating program:

1. **Define the code generation rules** - The first step is to define rules for generating the code. This involves deciding on the input format for the program, the structure of the output code, and the logic for generating the code. You can use a domain specific language to define the code generation rules, or you can write rules directly in your programming language of choice.

2. **Parse the input** - Once you have defined the code generation rules, you need to parse the input data to extract the relevant information. Depending on the input format, you may eed to use regular expressions or other parsing trcniques to extract the necessary data.

3. **Generate the code** - After parsing the input data, you can use the code generation rules to generate the output code. This may involve generating code in a specific programming language, generating markup code for web development, or generating other types of code depending on your needs.

4. **Write the output** - Once the code generation is complete, you need to write the output code to a file or stream. You can us file i/o functions or write the output to a database or other storage mediums depending on your needs

5. **Test and refine** - Finally, you need to test the generated code to ensure that it works as expected. If there are any issues or errors, you can refine the code generation rules and repeat the process until the generated code meets your requirements 

Overall, writing a code-generating program can be a powerful way to automate repetitive tasks and imrove the efficiency of you programming workflow. However it requires a deep understanding of programming concepts and can be more complex than traditional programming techniques.
