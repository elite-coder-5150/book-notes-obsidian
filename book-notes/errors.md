error TS2468: Cannot find global value 'Promise'.

###### ANSWER | GPT-4 MODEL

The error "TS2468: Cannot find global value 'Promise'" occurs when the TypeScript compiler cannot find the Promise object, which is part of the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) standard. This issue can arise if your TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) does not include the necessary settings to support Promise.

To resolve this error, you can add the appropriate settings to your tsconfig.json file. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Open your tsconfig.json file.

2. Locate the "compilerOptions" object.

3. Add the "lib" property to the "compilerOptions" object, specifying the necessary libraries, such as "es2015.promise" or "es2018" and "dom". For example:

`{   "compilerOptions": {     ...     "lib": ["es2018", "dom"],     ...   } }`

Alternatively, you can also use the following configuration:

`{   "compilerOptions": {     ...     "lib": ["es5", "dom", "es2015.promise"],     ...   } }`

4. Save the tsconfig.json file.

5. Re-run your TypeScript compilation command (e.g.,Â `tsc`).

The error should now be resolved, and your TypeScript code should compile successfully.

If you still encounter issues, make sure you have properly initialized your TypeScript project with the correct settings. For example, you can run the following command to initialize a TypeScript project with the "es2018" target:
