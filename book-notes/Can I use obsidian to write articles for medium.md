The short answer is yes, I can use Obsidian to write articles for Medium. Obsidian is a popular note-taking and knowledge management application that uses plain text files stored in a local folder structure. While its primarly desined for personal knowledge management and writing, you can export your written content form Obsidian and then copy and post it into Medium editor for publishing.

To export your content from Obsidian, you can use the built-in export feature or simply copy the text from your notesand paste it into a Markdown editor or a text editor. From there, you can make any necessary adjustments or formating changes before copying and pasting it into Mediums editor.

Keep in mind that when exporting from Obsidian, you will need to ensure that the formatting and styles are compatible with Medium's editor. Medium uses its own editor, which may have its own formatting options and limitations. Therefore, you may need to adjust headings, bullet points, images, and other element as needed to match Meidums formatting guideines.

Overall, while obsidian is not directly integrated with medium, you can certainly leverage its features for writing and organizing you content before exporting it for publishing on the medium Platform.
